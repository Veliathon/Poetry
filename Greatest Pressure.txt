The Greatest Pressure. 


There was a time, not long ago, adventures lost below the flow.

What pressure crushed this vessel so, I say it wasn't water though.

A silvered tongue, to wrap a mind and spin a tale so sublime.

That no-one should resist its charm, and cast aside impending harm.

A hubris, rich in boyish flair, placated by the greying hair.

To give an air of age and reason, to question it akin to treason.

A weatherd face, to clam onces thoughts, when troubles rise assume its naught.

I ask again, what crushed their frames, as water seems in contrast tame.

They had no chance.
