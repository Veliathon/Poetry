Are we history ?
By Veliathon

New eyes, blink, a child is born.
Potential held in arms, no anguish or lorn.
We say, "this is not history".

Childhood delights, summers spent playing.
Innocent hands, grassy fields laying.
We say, "this is not history".

Adolescent trials, questions and learnings.
First loves bud, listless and yearning.
We say, "this is not history".

Adulthood weighs, shouldered with price.
Joy and Sadness, mixed together play nice.
We say, "this is not history".

Twilight looms, seeking to rest.
Legacy formed, in countenance to test.
We say, "this is not history".

Silence held, name unspoken.
Eternal rest, perpetual, unbroken.
We say, "this is not history".

We were wrong.
