Lions Folly

Here bequeths a tale untold,
on savannahs golden, lands of old.

A lion of great vigor, roamed the land.
Zebra his quarry, sanguine stained sands.

None would best him, a kill lest a week.
The equines, plot formed, cunning and sleek.

No chase would they give, lay next to the hunter.
Each day on the hour, death came with a saunter.

The lion tore victim, met their approach.
In time though, the hunt relaxed to a poach.

The feasts did not falter, season to season.
But folly befalls, those who question no reason.

The king of the beasts, now immobile with glut.
Found curious the sight, of the Zebra in strut.

They circled the hunter, whom laboured in breath.
In unison, trampled and bit him to death.
